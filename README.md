# MarineBioMaps Dashboard

## Authors: Bailey Jørgensen, Madison Enda, Michelle Yiv

### Contributors: Cori Lopazanski, Samantha Stevenson-Karl, Joshua Smith

This is the repository that houses the Shiny dashboard exhibiting a series of interactive maps created by the MBM team, as well as a link to the pdf of the official report generated by the project. The dashboard itself is not meant to exhibit the entire analysis, but rather house the report that contains the entire analysis, and provide a series of interactive maps that allow users to engage with the data used in the complete analysis in an interactive and exciting way.
